# 19 Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor
## Description

This project was to create a progressive web application text editor using a client server model and webpack. This project was very helpful to become more familiar and comfortable with progressive web applications and using the client server model. I was able to critically think through debugging errors in the console and database storage. I was also able to work through errors in order to get the application installable as an application. Overall, this was very helpful in my full stack development joruney.
